## Description

_A service station is a place almost everyone has visited. These places carry out a number of tasks (services). Most of the time people would just take their vehicle and go to the service center and see if there is a free slot so that they can get their vehicle serviced. This creates a wastage of time on the customers’ side and this also affects the workflow and customer base of the service center on the service center side. Based on these difficulties faced by both parties, we “NOICE DEVS” created a mobile application called “NOICE SERVICE” to counter the issues we identified._
